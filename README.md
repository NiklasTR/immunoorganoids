# immuneorganoid project
The goal of this project is to study the interaction of patient derived in-vitro cancer models with primary NK-cells and myeloid cells.

## experiment_011
A key informative experiment was a test of multiple conditions with unstimulated allogenic PBMC used as dummy effector cells. 
384 well uclear plates with tissue culture treatment were seeded with 50ul of organoid/PBMC suspension (PBMC 0.2M cells/ml, D080T01 at regular photon count intensity ~Â 2500). 

A series of notes on the experimental setup below: 
* Given the previous knowledge about the negative effects of Nicotinamide on leukocyte activity, we tested regular organoid media without Nicotinamide and with Nicotinamide. ENA + Nicotinamide is the regular medium used for cancer organoid culture.
* Previous tests within the lab as well as from other groups suggests that organoids can be kept in a medium containing a 5% gel suspension. As a consequence we did not add gel coating, but added 5% BME V2 to the medium in conditions marked with "+gel". 
* The standard medium for organoid co-culture developed in Mannheim is a 50% ENA (no Nicotinamide) 50% RPMI mixture. The RPMI medium contains 10% FCS. 
* All plates contain the same number of unstimulated allogenic PBMCs from the same unidentified donor. All PBMCs were defrosted on the same day and were a gift from Mannheim.

The treatment conditions for the 9 plates are as follows: 
1. ENA + Nicotinamide + gel + organoid
2. ENA  + gel + organoid
3. 50%ENA50%RPMI + gel + organoid
4. 50%ENA50%RPMI + organoid 
5. ENA + Nicotinamide + gel
6. ENA + gel
7. 50%ENA50%RPMI + gel
8. RPMI + gel
9. 50%ENA50%RPMI

data from these experiments are stored on the B110 Isilon2: immuneorganoids/data/raw
