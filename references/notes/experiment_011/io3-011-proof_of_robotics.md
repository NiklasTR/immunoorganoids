### incoming questions from [[io3-010-proof_of_principle]]
1. PBMC did not make it until day 8 in good shape - what are the systemic effects of RPMI vs 50% RPMI vs ENA on cells
2. what are the liquid handling implications for cocultures in suspension gel
3. what are the viabilty implications for the gel

## conditions
phenotype  ~ [[treatment]] + [[culture medium]] + [[coculture]] + [[liquid handler]]

phenotype - dynamic range to distinguish viability

lilquid handler - QC effects vs. non-robotic plates
treatment - clinical library
culture medium - ENA, RPMI, 50%, +/- gel = 6 conditions
coculture - 2 plates with organoids


2 types of plates: 
* co-culture plates - 2 plates
	* organoids + PBMC
	* ENA + gel
	* half plates for non-robotic monitoring - used for CTG
* PBMC plates - 6 plates

seeded plates 
row A-D on plate prolif 2 are interpreteable


8 plates of PBMC in total
experience before: 50ml of medium at 200k/ml cells for 1 tube - 2 plates
for 10 plates I need to thaw 5 vials (+1 backup)

I need to order new PBMCs - keep 1 vial as backup for single cell RNA-Seq



[[syto 14]] dye does not work well at the used concentration, will be removed 
[[concanavalin a]] stains the outer membrane and the gel - which is very useful to identify the "craters" of dead organoids

acquired a set of wells at 
40x and 20x 

acquired the whole plate at 4x


used library 21

for demo, pulling images from well C09, which contains [[DMSO]]

## data
Thilo performed CTG measurements for two proliferation plates, one at the day of compound treatment and the other plate on the day of harvest. Interpretation of the CTG data is still pending.
