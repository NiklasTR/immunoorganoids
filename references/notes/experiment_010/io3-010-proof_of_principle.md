### questions - [[known unknown]]
1. how does treatment in suspension culture plates work?
2. how does RPMI+FCS compare with compatibility medium in imageing space?
3. what is the optimal density? 
4. what is the recovery percentage after thawing? 
5. what are the liquid handling properties of 5% gel suspension?

### model
[[morphology]] ~ medium I PBMC line 1, TC treated plates, homemade fix, 8 days of experiment

### procedure

## results
### interim results day 3 of culture
* [[PBMC]] appear still mostly viable although no proliferation has taken place
* the viability in [[RPMI medium]] and without [[matrigel]] appears higher, the [[cell morphology]] is uniform and round
* the viability in 50% [[ENA medium]] is relatively intact, the [[cell morphology]] is more heterogeneous with some cells actively attaching to the surface of the tissue culture treated plates
* [[matrigel]] leads to a less concentrated spatial distribution of cells - probably simply mechanics. Existing cells seem to have compromised viability relative to their counterparts

I am not performing a medium change

### day 8 of culture 
inspecting cells on wednesday, 8 days afterwards, due to [[disease]]
fixing cells by adding 10ul of 8% w/v [[PFA]] to wells, [[plate sealer]] and storage [[4C]]. 

* the [[ENA medium]] medium has has a viability penalty on [[PBMC]] relative to [[RPMI medium]] when cultured for sustained period of time
* [[matrigel]] leads to a spatial spreading of cells within the well and appears to come with a viability penalty, too 
* [[macrophage]] attached firmly to the bottom of the plate in the [[matrigel]] free conditions

## discussion
### answers
1. NA
2. [[compatibility medium]] comes with [[viability]] penalty
3. [[PBMC]] [[cell seeding]] density is 200k/ml for [[384 well plate]] (10k cells per well) - this needs no correction when adding organoids, I think
4. 90% recovery ~Â 5-10M / tube
5. NA

### new questions for [[io3-012-cytokine_viability]]
1. PBMC did not make it until day 8 in good shape - how can we increase viability and shorten the experiment? 
2. what is the impact of suspension plates? vs. TC-treated plates? 
3. 


## notes
2 images for 10k/well and 5k per well respectivelz

![[IO3010.pdf]]

how does density and medium influence morphology? 

* prepare [[PBMC medium]]


2 [[384 well plate]] = 50ml of medium at 200k/ml cells

dilute 2x up and down

dilute cells to 

40ml at 400k/ml cells
40ml at 200k/ml cells
40ml at 100k/ml cells

## future
compare ULA with TC plate
seed both PBMC and organoids


single cell RNA-Seq of 10 samples

how does plate treatment influence morphology?
how does co-culture influence morphology?

[[morphology]] ~ plate treatment + coculture I PBMC line 1, homemade fix, fixed density

* viability after 3 days
* differences in morphology between gel treatment and medium treatment?
